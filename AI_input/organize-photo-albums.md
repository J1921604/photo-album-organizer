/speckit.specify 
Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. 
Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. 
Albums are never in other nested albums. 
Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface.

/speckit.plan 
The application uses Vite with minimal number of libraries. 
Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible. 
Images are not uploaded anywhere and metadata is stored in a local SQLite database.
